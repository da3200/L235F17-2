<font color="white">My name is Dylan and I am interesting in studying film at Bard College. I've always been interested in telling stories, 
  which is why I've written several short books--two of which are available online for sale; they are called "Bermuda",
  and "Easter Island". I've always loved the idea of creation--being able to create somehting of my own that others can
  enjoy. I hope to be able to produce my stories into full movies in the future.</font>
