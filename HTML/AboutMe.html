<font color="white">My name is Dylan and I am interested in studying film at Bard College. I've always been interested in telling stories,
    <br>
  which is why I've written several short books--two of which are available online for sale; they are called "Bermuda",
    <br>
  and "Easter Island". I've always loved the idea of creation--being able to create somehting of my own that others can
    <br>
  enjoy. I hope to be able to produce my stories into full movies in the future. As of now, I've made a few short films
    <br>
      for my YouTube channel with me and my friends; two of them are under the Videos page of this site.</font>
